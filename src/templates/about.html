					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our aim is to facilitate a mutually beneficial relationship between businesses and patrons. When customers purchase your products, they have opinions about them - opinions that often indicate ways by which products can be improved. We offer a free platform through which your patrons can quickly and easily provide valuable feedback that is linked to relevant factors, making it easy for you to improve your products, retain patrons, and receive actionable insight to create a better overall patron experience. It's as easy as entering your questionnaire into your apfyt profile and integrating our individualized, time-stamped scan codes onto your receipts! <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An additional service we provide for app users and business partners is the Deal of the Day, a daily offer that all of our users view on the home screen of the Apfyt app. This feature showcases the business' appreciation for its customers and reminds  users of what their communities have to offer. 
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apfyt also provides you with the capability to post customized, packaged user ratings on chosen aspects of your survey response receptions.</p>
